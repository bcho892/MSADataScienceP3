# MSA Data Science P3

Welcome to my part 3 repo! 

Some things to note: 
* I've included the CIFAR-10 dataset in the repo
* My model is named final-model.h5
  * The services folder contains a copy of it which is what I use to make an API with the model
* Everything related to the basic process is in the 'make-model' notebook
* My 'report' notebook contains the main summary of my project.

### Summary of performance
* 0.956 Accuracy
* Local minimum loss found at ~4 epochs

### Advanced Features attempted
* Hyperparameter Tuning (Specifically for the dropout and optimizer)
* Predict for given image function (done using inbuilt tensorflow libraries)
* Integration into front-end [(can be viewed here)](https://github.com/bcho892/MSAFrontEnd)
